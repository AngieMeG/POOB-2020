HOW TO PLAY
 
Choose a player to go first. On your turn, move any one of your checkers by the movement
rules described below. After you move one checker, your turn is over. The game continues
with players alternating turns.
 
 
MOVEMENT RULES
 
* Always move your checker diagonally forward, toward your opponent's side of the gameboard.
Note: After a checker becomes a King, it can move diagonally forward or backward.
 
* Move your checker one space diagonally, to an open adjacent square; or jump one or more
checkers diagonally to an open square adjacent to the checker you jumped. When you
jump over an opponent's checker, you capture it (see Capturing an Opponent's Checker).
 
* If all squares adjacent to your checker are occupied, your checker is blocked and
cannot move.
 
 
CAPTURING A OPPONENT'S CHECKER
 
If you jump an opponent's checker, you capture it. Remove it from the gameboard and
place it in front of you.
 
 
BECOMING A KING
 
As soon as one of your checkers reaches the first row on your opponent's side of the
gameboard, it becomes a King. Place another checker of the same color on top of it. Now
this double-decker checker can move forward or backward on the gameboard.
